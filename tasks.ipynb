As it applies to every possible positive integer, its not yet possible to prove for every case. It can be defined in mathematical notation as\n",

The data was collected by Dr Kristen Gorman and features data about the characteristics of three species of penguins on three islands in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica. It contains seven fields columns of observations, three of which are Categorical (Species, Sex and Island) and three of which are Quantative or Continuous (Bill length, Bill depth, Flipper length,Body mass). There are a total of 344 rows of data, each representing 1 penguin. \n",
